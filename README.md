# PyProjNeyro
Built with simplicity in mind, ImageAI supports a list of state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms for image prediction, custom image prediction, object detection, video detection, video object tracking and image predictions trainings. ImageAI currently supports image prediction and training using 4 different Machine Learning algorithms trained on the ImageNet-1000 dataset. ImageAI also supports object detection, video detection and object tracking using RetinaNet, YOLOv3 and TinyYOLOv3 trained on COCO dataset. Finally, ImageAI allows you to train custom models for performing detection and recognition of new objects.

Eventually, ImageAI will provide support for a wider and more specialized aspects of Computer Vision

Real-Time and High Performance Implementation
ImageAI provides abstracted and convenient implementations of state-of-the-art Computer Vision technologies. All of ImageAI implementations and code can work on any computer system with moderate CPU capacity. However, the speed of processing for operations like image prediction, object detection and others on CPU is slow and not suitable for real-time applications. To perform real-time Computer Vision operations with high performance, you need to use GPU enabled technologies.

ImageAI uses the PyTorch backbone for it's Computer Vision operations. PyTorch supports both CPUs and GPUs ( Specifically NVIDIA GPUs. You can get one for your PC or get a PC that has one) for machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms' implementations.

AI Practice Recommendations
For anyone interested in building AI systems and using them for business, economic, social and research purposes, it is critical that the person knows the likely positive, negative and unprecedented impacts the use of such technologies will have. They must also be aware of approaches and practices recommended by experienced industry experts to ensure every use of AI brings overall benefit to mankind. We therefore recommend to everyone that wishes to use ImageAI and other AI tools and resources to read Microsoft's January 2018 publication on AI titled "The Future Computed : Artificial Intelligence and its role in society". Kindly follow the link below to download the publication.
